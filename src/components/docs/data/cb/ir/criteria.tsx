    <p>The evaluation of insulation resistance test results is based on established criteria that consider factors such as:
      Manufacturer specifications and recommendations for insulation resistance values.
      Industry standards and guidelines (e.g., IEC, IEEE, NEMA).
      Regulatory requirements (e.g., OSHA regulations).
      Comparison with baseline or historical data for the circuit breaker.
      Environmental conditions and operating parameters that may affect insulation performance.
      This comprehensive outline should provide a thorough understanding of insulation resistance testing of circuit breakers and its significance in ensuring electrical safety and equipment reliability. Adjust and expand each section as needed to suit the specific requirements of your documentation.
