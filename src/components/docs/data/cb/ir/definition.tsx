      Insulation resistance testing of circuit breakers is a diagnostic procedure aimed at evaluating the condition and integrity of the insulation material within the circuit breaker. It involves measuring the resistance of the insulation between conductive parts and ground, typically conducted at a high voltage, to ensure that the insulation is effective in preventing electrical leakage.
      Insulation resistance testing involves applying a high voltage across the insulation of the circuit breaker and measuring the resulting current flow. This test is typically performed using specialized equipment known as insulation resistance testers or megohmmeters. The procedure may include:
      Preparation of the circuit breaker for testing, including isolation from power sources and ensuring safety precautions are in place.
      Application of a test voltage to the insulation and measurement of the resulting current flow.
      Recording and interpretation of insulation resistance values.
      Analysis of test results to identify any abnormalities, trends, or areas of concern.
