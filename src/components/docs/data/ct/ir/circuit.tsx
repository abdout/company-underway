      	Insulation-resistance tests shall be made with all circuits of equal voltage above ground connected together.
      	Circuits or groups of circuits of different voltage above ground shall be tested separately. Examples of procedures include the following: 
      a)  High voltage to low voltage and ground, low voltage to high voltage and ground.
      b)  Voltage should be increased in increments of usually 1 kV to 5 kV and held for 1 min while        the current is read.
      c) The test should be discontinued immediately if the current begins to increase without stabilizing.
      d)  After the test has been completed, all terminals should be grounded for enough time to allow any trapped charges to decay to a negligible value.
